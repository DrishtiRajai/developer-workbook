## 📂 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   git clone https://github.com/DrishtiRajai/todo-app.git
2. Navigate into the folder
   cd todo-app
3. Double click index.html

💡 How It Works
On first load, the app populates with sample todos stored in localStorage.
All changes (add, delete, complete, reorder) are saved automatically.

Tasks can be reordered via drag & drop, and filters let you view tasks by status.

📈 Learning Outcomes

DOM manipulation with vanilla JS
Using browser storage APIs
Implementing drag-and-drop interfaces
Writing clean, reusable code
