Hi, I am Drishti, a WordPress Developer and you are currently looking at a repository that is filled with work that I did as a part of my training. It includes individual frontend designs that I practiced from front end mentor, some short projects like URL shortener and a wordpress website: online book library. 
Feel free to clone it. Dont forget to run npm install then. Keep in mind each folder is a seperate project, big or small.  
Also, for any suggestions and advice, dont hesitate to reach me at drishtirajai7@gmail.com.
